# ASKDOUBT- VSCode Extension for Copilot

This VSCode extension allows you to make calls to Groqcloud for information on selected text in the editor. It adds GPT-related query options to the right-click menu. You will need to enter and securely store a Groqcloud API key.



## Usage


Select any text in your editor, right-click, and choose "Answerit" from the context menu. This action will retrieve an answer and insert it below the selected text in the editor.


## Development Tips

To run use "Menu -> Run -> Start Debugging". This opens up a separate VSCode window to test the extension in.
